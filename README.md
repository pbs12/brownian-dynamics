# Brownian Dynamics
brownianDynamics.m is an implementation of overdamped Langevin dymanics (an algorithm for stochastically evolving molecular systems in **implicit** solvent) for an arbitrary number of particles in a given N-dimensional space. Included are tools for calculating mean first-passage times of a pair of particles in this space, optionally while they are diffusing inside of a harmonic potential (**read:** spring-like attachment to a specific coordinate). Post-simulation analysis tools that are included: 1) if harmonic potential is on), check that the particles obey the expected Boltzmann distribution during initialization and the simulation run, and 2) check that the mean-squared displacement of the particle ensemble obeys that predicted by the Stokes-Einstein relation.
